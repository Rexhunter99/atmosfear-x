AtmosFEAR X is a completely open-source sandbox game engine developed by gamers for gamers based off of the not well known AtmosFEAR 2 game engine which was originally developed by three programmers at Action Forms in Ukraine.

AtmosFEAR X is rewritten in C++ 11 using modern techniques and libraries, is cross-platform with Windows and Linux Distributions like Debian and Ubuntu (untested on other distributions and platforms) and has a small memory footprint.

Users may report bugs here in our Issue Tracker for programmers to fix and programmers are welcome to join the project and to fix any bugs they please or add new features.

For a list of current features and planned features, please check the [Engine features](Features.md) Page.

A thank you to the original AtmosFEAR 2 development team and a special thank you to Alexey Menshikov for his support.
