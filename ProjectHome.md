Over the years, AtmosFEAR 2, the engine notoriously known as the backend for Carnivores 2 and Carnivores: Ice Age for PC, has aged quite well, sadly it is not very compatible with newer hardware.

AtmosFEAR X originally started as a project to increase compatibility of the engine, however blossomed into a fully fledged game engine evolution. Almost 80% of the original source-code written by Action Forms in 1998-2000 has been gutted and rewritten entirely from the ground up with many optimisations and performance tweaks thrown in.  The game now achieves 120+ fps under OpenGL on modern hardware and is far more compatible than ever before.

The project was made open source so that others may contribute their own work to improve this game engine as it evolves and to even take the engine as it is and change it into something else.

Please check the [Wiki](https://code.google.com/p/atmosfear-x/wiki/Introduction) for further details.


Special thank you to the Action Forms team for developing this game engine and giving us such a long leash with it.
